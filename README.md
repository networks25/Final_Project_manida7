# gocomics_viewer

This project is a simple Python program that scrapes comics from **gocomics.com**
and displays them in a graphical window.

Given a GoComics series URL (https://gocomics.com/pearlsbeforeswine), the program:
- Finds the latest comic
- Shows the comic image
- Allows navigation to **previous** and **next** comics using buttons

This project was created as a small web-scraping and GUI practice project.
